MoparScape is a site primarily revolving around [RuneScape][1] private servers. We have been around since roughly 2006 starting off as a few boards on our mother site [Moparisthebest.com][2] and eventually growing into our own site with a wide array of forums boards ranging from graphics to general programming and we're still growing yet with over half a million registered users. MoparScape is a great resource if you need to get started and make your way through RSPS. If you already have a server and are looking for players, take a look at our [Server Status Page][6] and [Server Advertisements][7] board.

Here at MoparScape we have several aids to assist you in creating your own RuneScape private server, first and foremost you can download all the files you will need from [Server Downloads][3], you can then read over some tutorials in the [Server Tutorials][4] board and finally, if you need some help you can check out the [Server Help][5] board. If you aren't interested in RSPS feel free to contribute where you feel you can, website development, graphics, or whatever it may be. Be sure to read the [Global Rules][8] before posting though. We also have an IRC network, if that tickles your fancy. You can find us at irc.moparscape.org on port 6667 in the #moparscape channel, or use our [Web IRC][9]. Alongside all of this we also have the [MoparScape Client][11] which is a great resource for anyone wishing to start up their own server or just fool around locally; a must read for anyone with an interest in RSPS. You can also access the MoparScape webclient [here][12].

If you have any further questions on MoparScape or its ideals and you can't find them on the forums, don't hesitate to contact a [Staff Member][10] and they will answer your question to the best of their ability.

Happy posting!
