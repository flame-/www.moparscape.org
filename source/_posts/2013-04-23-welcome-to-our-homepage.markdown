Welcome to our new homepage!

After much discussion, meetings and months of planning by the staff members the homepage is finally ready for release. We did consider using [WordPress][1] but WordPress comes with some complications towards our setup. Mainly because Wordpress to SMF integration is a complete pain to try and do. We eventually decided on [OctoPress][2] which is a great [Jekyll][3] based blogging software. Let us know what you think!

We also need some help from you guys, what do you think we should feature on the homepage and blog about? We've had a few ideas floating around but nothing has been finalised yet and there's no exact criteria to be featured or what to actually feature. A good thing about OctoPress is that anyone can write a post or a blog entry by just forking [Moparisthebest's Github repository][4] add it, and put in a pull request and if Moparisthebest approves, it'll be committed and shown here! If you don't want to, or can't use github, just write another post in [this format][5] and email it to [Moparisthebest][6], though github submissions will be handled faster. I strongly suggest that if you want to take part in this, you read the [OctoPress blogging basics][7] documentation article.
