This month on the Mopar Monthly:
Much helpful. Very community. So effort. Wow

Welcome to the Mopar Monthly interview! In this section, you will be able to see a MoparScape member answer a selection of interview questions about a variety of topics. Every month will see a different member interviewed which means that next month's member could be you! This month's interviewee is TabbyKiller. We hope you enjoy the read!

* To start the interview, please tell us a bit about yourself. You can let us know about hobbies, aspirations, or anything else you'd like to share.

> My name is Mason McLeod-Ngatuere, I was given both my mothers and fathers surnames. I give of the impression to most people I meet that I am a genuinely quiet, shy person, though, throw a few beers on top of that I'll prove you wrong. I'm not much of a drinker to be honest. Ever since I started hitting the gym I've over looked alcohol. I've never taken drugs before and I never will, peer pressure will never get me. As for my hobbies I do love Photography. Photography is a huge thing that I want to do later on in life. Its a struggle really. I'm tossed between 4 things that I want to be. Recently a mate of mine just got back on leave from the Navy, he's pushing me towards going with him, and I want to but that means dropping university next year. Another thing I want to be is a Photographer, who would have guessed? The third thing I want to be and is probably a passion of mine is a film maker. I love films and I love editing them. I cannot get enough of putting good footage and good music together. The end result is very self rewarding. Oh yes, music... I love it to the bones, I really do. The last thing I really aspire to be is a homicide detective, or even a cop for that matter. The thing that pushes me to wanting to be a cop is for one, you're required to keep fit. Two, I hate to see people slide just because some cops are too lazy to do their job. Three, being a cop means you have to be social and outgoing. Some people say you don't need to keep fit to be a cop once you have past the tests, which is true, most cops just let go once they're past the tests but that's one thing that drives me nuts about cops. They're meant to be someone to look up to. Someone to expect to feel safe around. I really mean no offense to anyone but no one wants a lard ass lazy cop out there searching for rapists and murderers etc. It really is a bold thing to say but believe me, it does happen. I kind of lost my train of thought but basically I want to be so many things, so many greats things and I'm lucky to have a friend named Jake is helps me realize that I can be everything I want to be.

* What originally brought you to MoparScape and what in particular, if anything, kept you here all this time?

> Most cases that bring people here is RuneScape. Naturally at the age I was I wanted to cheat RuneScape. I wanted to know what it felt holding a party hat. This didn't get me Googling though. One night I had spotted my brother playing what I thought was RuneScape, but, he was wearing a red party hat. Then he said to come over and he killed a Goblin and it dropped another red party hat. Not knowing how useless these party hats were on these private servers I joined and started filling my inventory with red party hats. I proudly walked around spawn (I think it was the barbarian village as a spawn) with red party hats. Eventually I found out we could make our own server and so I did a lot of Googling and found the MoparScape client. I was still really confused but followed tutorials to set this up. I eventually got it working with the MoparScape client and I could log in at Varrock (around the bank area between the mining place). That all the story is for getting me to MoparScape. I joined and was a pain in the ass 100% of the time, I really was. I made really bad servers and really bad models. Though I was still getting praised for it even though it was total bull.
The thing that kept me here at MoparScape was probably the fact that I knew I could learn something off of these smart people. I saw those mitb people and idolized them even though they were complete dicks, every single one of them. Though I'm not going to lie but I did have an internet crush on maminerr. Being a kid on a teenage and adult forum sucked.

* What do you realistically see yourself doing in five years time?

> Well I like to think I'd have a nice girlfriend, I don't want to be lonely. I like to think I'd be starting on production for the film "The Last of Us" in which I will bribe the rights from Sony. I'll be continuing my Photography ambition. The only way I see myself being successful with film and photography is YouTube. Everything is starting to rely on social networking websites in my opinion and taking advantage of that by using YouTube as a start would be in my train of thought, quite successful.

* Has your opinion of the community changed at all since you have become a moderator? If so, how?

> I think I'm pretty chilled about the situation. I check in every night before going to bed to make sure there is nothing against the rules. Anytime I'm at home I will check every 10 minutes or so. But no. I don't think my opinion has changed at all. I do what I do and I still communicate the same way, just a little more professionally. Image is everything when given power right?

* Which member of MoparScape would you have to say is the most inspirational, and why?

> Easily Taharok. He's very mature, very smart and overall is just a nice guy. When I was basically a crippled young boy (metaphorically speaking) on these forums I would send him the most stupid suggestions for MoparScape and he'd reply with a nice comment. It's embarassing to show but this was one of them [here](http://gyazo.com/b2c9630d138d3ab8e3641ab399e36f2e.png).

* What advice would you give to someone wishing to become more involved in the community?

> Just get in there. You learn from failure, so don't be afraid to try anything and think you're going to fail.

* What attracted you to photography, and why do you pursue it as a hobby?

> I just absolutely love being able to take a photo. You can capture a split second of beauty and look over it as many times as you want. You can turn something really dull into something beauty with photography. It really is amazing.

* What would be your main tip to anyone interesting in starting photography?

> A nice camera isn't everything. Photography is all about meaning. Whether its a self portrait or a memorable photo with friends, as long as it has meaning, it is beautiful.

* Which user in the community would you describe as "most likely to be successful"?

> Its really a toss between Yz85Racer and Ruby. Both people are enjoying life and still save time to play games or browse these forums. Yz85Racer is fit and is actually quite educated in health and fitness, personally I see these is a huge trait of success. Ruby has a sexy Scottish accent and what better way to be successful than with a sexy accent. But bother than that he enjoys himself in life.

* If you had to liken MoparScape to any video game, which one would you choose, and why?

> I'm not to knowledgeable with classic video games but if I were to choose one I'd choose Zelda. Just like Zelda, MoparScape has history. Its nostalgic and built a lot of respect for being simple and smart.

* What made you choose your username?

> It's going to sound a little nerdy haha. But before I joined MoparScape I had an account called Tabby106 I think it was on RuneScape. Being 12ish I was not very educated and my account was scammed off me. From that day on I vowed to hunt my old account Tabby106 and created another account called TabbyKiller which was later banned for botting, haha. So no guys, I do not literally kill cats :)

* To close the interview, do you have any final words?

> Thank you for actually taking the time to read through the whole thing. Though its likely you just skipped the long paragraphs right? Everything I say about MoparScape is true. It, we and they can really help you learn. Whether its programming, 3D modelling, photography, graphics. MoparScape really is a place where people can start to learn and share their skills.
