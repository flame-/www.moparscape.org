##Sub-Edition: Interview #5
---

Due to a tight schedule from school and sports, the Mopar Monthly interview had to be delayed for a few days until time could be made for the interview. Our apologies for the wait, but we think it was well worth it. This month's interviewed member was the friendly community Java Guru, Sinisoul.

* To start the interview, tell us a bit about yourself: things such as interests, hobbies, whatever info you're comfortable sharing, etc.

> Well, outside of RSPS I enjoy doing engineering, graphic design, and swimming. I help teach a graphic design class for middle schoolers, and enjoy working with younger kids to help prepare them for highschool. I did FIRST robotics for three years and I was the lead programmer. I'm embarassed to say but most of the time I did all the programming in one day, it wasn't very complex. Not nearly as complex as RSPS server work. I graduated last year, and I'm going to college at a local state university next year and besides that I enjoy going out and doing random things with friends.

* What originally got you into programming and engineering? Is it something you'd be willing to do as a job in the future?

> I was always an engineering guy when I was younger. I did a program called Destination Imagination in middle school; we built crazy contraptions to complete tasks and it also had a bit of drama involved so we had to incorporate it all with a theme and put on a play. I became interested in programming around that time but did not get involved with it heavily until I was a freshman in highschool, which is when I got involved with RSPS. I still enjoy building things and both engineering and programming fill that desire. When I joined FIRST robotics I already had a year of java experience. To note, the highschool I went to had an engineering class where we modeled bikes on CAD programs, but I became less interested with that because the process was very slow and boring. I enjoy programming more today because it has a much faster pace to it.

* What do you see yourself doing in the future, perhaps jobs, socially, or school?

> You know, I was always an introvert but I really would like to try and get a job where I could be working with people. I enjoy teaching, to a certain extent. I do not like the politics. But with the upcoming ESports market there may be a place there for me. I haven't nailed down an exact career but I know I want to move towards the technology field. A dream job would be to work for Riot Games, I enjoy the company model and how transparent they are with their customers. That is how I would run a company, and I'd be very proud to follow in their footsteps.

* Being one of the lead developers for the MoparScape server, what are your plans for it, and do you see it becoming popular in the future?

> Well, I don't have any immediate plans. I do have ideas of how I want the finished product to function. I'm very open to how we want to approach the server, before when I was solo developing once an idea popped in my head I just implemented it but now that I'm in a team environment I can't do that. I think David and I are both on the same page, we both want to have a more 'remake' like server. That's already taking shape. We don't cut corners with the content we do. As for popularity, I see it becoming very popular actually. At least I hope so! :) Mostly because I know MITB will be able to assure stability.

* Are you personally planning on adding any custom content to the game to any extent?

> No. I don't like custom content and it's too much of a mess to implement it in a 'clean' manner. Although, that's just my opinion. I am open to what the community wants. This isn't 'my' server, it's the community's.

* Can you tell us a bit more about the MoparScape server in terms of how it's being developed, and what sort of things you'd like to implement?

> The MoparScape server development is split between two modes, core and scripting. The server is designed so that any regular community member should not have to touch the core which is written completely in java. The scripting is in ruby and is setup in such a way where groups of scripts are organized by 'plugins'. They are not true plugins, you cannot unload and load them at will. There is not strict interfacing with how the scripts are loaded other than they are compiled on each rebuild and stored in a script environment object. Every time you reload the scripts, you essentially purge the previously compiled scripts if any exist. In terms of what I'd like to implement is cutting down the current memory usage. Its very high, I wasn't looking for any long term solution for pathfinding when I started and the current implementation is a bit bloated. When I have the time I will go through all the large systems and do a major rework to make them more efficient. Its common within RSPS to see the client in a different perspective and also you will hit snags in the way your systems function which make you question reworking chunks of code. But it will all be done in due time :)

* You recently went to the league of legends world championships. How was it? Would you recommend it to others?

> The event was fantastic! I went went a group of friends, three of us had tickets near each other and two of us had tickets in random places. I was fortunate to be able to get a suite with a fantastic view. All in all the environment was like a normal football game, but everyone was so friendly. I would suggest going to the finals if you ever get the chance because I got to meet so many pros and actually ask them questions. They were professional, but also kind. I think ESports will continue to grow as the years progress so getting tickets may be harder and harder to get but maybe they will keep opening at larger venues than the Staples Center. If there is a larger venue, I'm not sure if they have a larger stadium on the west coast.

* Is there anyone that you find inspirational in any aspects, be it from the forums, other websites, or outside of the internet?

> Hm. When I was doing RSPS I found a few people inspiration. I had the luck of talking to Blakeman a bit personally and I honestly enjoyed my conversations between him the most. That was around the time PRS06 shut down, I haven't seen him around the community since. I find super_, t4, silabsoft, taharok, and method all to be inspiration as well. Each played a role to help improve my skills as a programmer and for that I am very grateful.

* What are your thoughts on the Mopar Monthly, and where do you see it heading?

> The Mopar Monthly is well put together, although I think that it needs to reach out past glorifying people for writing tutorials. I understand giving a shoutout but it's annoying when there are much interesting things to report on. The Mopar Monthly should do some research on the past and come up with articles about how the scene evolved. Keep up with the interviews though! I really enjoy reading those.

* What sort of changing would you make on the forum if you had one day as an administrator?

> Hm. Well, that's a great question. I guess part of being a staff member is acknowledging the changes of the community. I don't have any immediate changes and I think the administrators are doing the best they can given that this isn't a full time job. I would try and help the community grow, and I think my way of doing that would be what I'm doing now which is the community server. I can't really think of what else I would do, and it's hard to think of being an administrator. There are so many duties besides just changing things as an admin. I don't think you can really just focus on 'changing' things but rather fostering growth in the current conditions in place.

* What drew you to MoparScape, and why do you stay?

> The Wanderer, one of my most respected friends, had me register here. My original community was Runelocus, but since the community there started dying I started going to Moparscape more.

* Are there any projects on MoparScape, be it RSPS or other developments, that draw your attention?

> Frell's game looks very well put together. Besides that I wander around the development section and I haven't seen anything attractive in awhile. No offense. I have a keen eye for unique servers and I don't see anything that strikes me as that.

* To close the interview, do you have any final words that you'd like to add?

> I love the community, I've had a lot of good moments there. Thank you to MITB and everyone who helped me get to the level of skill I am today. I owe a lot to the people I mentioned in this interview.
