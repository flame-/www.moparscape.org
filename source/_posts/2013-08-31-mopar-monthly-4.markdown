#####Section 5: An Interview With a Forum User


Well, we’re back to the spotlight of the Mopar Monthly - the interview. This month’s interview was held with [Niall](//www.moparscape.org/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=11). Enjoy the read!


* To start, why don’t you tell us a bit about yourself?


> Do I have to? :P Well, I’m Niall, currently 21. Not sure what else to say other than I’ve been on MITB since the beginning and was on Kaitnieks for a few years before that.


* Do you have any interests?
Certainly a few, I enjoy everything computer related from building them to the hardware in general, as well as programming. I quite enjoy photography but I'm not very good, and I'm currently learning the bass guitar. I also enjoy motorcycles but being unemployed there's a bit of a financial barrier there.


* If you had to choose a job for yourself, what would it be?


> If I knew what I wanted to do I’d be in university studying it. :P I really don’t know what I want to do but I think I’ll eventually have to get a job in computers (most likely as a system admin). A (very) long term goal is perhaps go to university for a degree in chemistry, and if I can hack it, go on to get a PHD but that's faaaaar down the line and will take close to a decade I think.


* What got you into programming and computer building?


> Well, funnily enough, SCAR is what got me into programming, back when I was playing RuneScape I was playing another MMO called “A Tale In The Desert” and I came across SCAR. While I didn’t use it much for RuneScape it was quite a good tool for use in ATiTD, especially since (if I remember correctly) macroing was partially allowed. Most people were using Autohotkey and similar programs which were severely underpowered compared to SCAR. I started learning Java a few years after SCAR but never got good at it, since then I've dabbled with a bit of Python, Perl, Ruby, Bash etc, I never really put the time and effort into learning a language but now that I have a few Android devices I've been thinking of picking Java up again. As for building computers, well, I needed a new computer and building them was the superior choice. It's just like an adult lego set really, at least, that's what my mum seemed to think after I took up her kitchen for a few hours!


* If you had to describe MITB or MoparScape in a few sentences, how would you describe it?


> Well, I would describe MITB as the phoenix that rose out of the ashes that was Kaitnieks, it's now an abandoned ruins. I’d describe MoparScape similarly, it’s the phoenix that rose out of MITB. What I always found interesting was before there was a dedicated MoparScape forums, the traffic of the people who wanted private servers far exceeded the rest of the traffic on MITB...at least, after Aryan died down. The need for the MoparScape board was due to everyone posting in every section of MITB asking for private server help. Once MoparScape started to grow, MITB kind of tagged along, with the long time members of MITB being generally the elders of the community while MoparScape was the young, thriving scene that attracted all of the attention.


* Is there anyone on the forums that you find to be particularly motivating?


> Well, I had high hopes for the debates section but not many people seem interested in it. :P Unfortunately, I’ve always been more interested in MITB than MoparScape, and I quit playing RuneScape shortly after joining MITB and mostly stuck around for the community. On MoparScape, though, I do like the more recent additions of the programming sections, and the forums becoming less of a private server board and more of a general interests board. I’ve never been too interested in the private server side so I can’t really speak about that unfortunately. :P


* During your time as an administrator, was there anything you learned about managing a community and how to keep it functional? what skills did you pick up, if any?


> Yes, I learned I was a freaking horrible admin :P In my defence this was YEARS ago now and I was a young lad, but I definitely think the power went to my head. I think the experience made me a better person though, it taught me to try to take an unbiased approach and to try to view things from everyone’s perspective.


* Would you ever take up the position again?


> I've been thinking of it recently but Avail and Tom were added to the administrators, and they're more capable and more active than I ever was :P


* Would you do it all over again if given the opportunity?


> Of course! it was great fun albeit hair-pulling stressful at times. I'd certainly do things a lot differently however. I remember a few great instances that could have been avoided, at some point global moderators had the capacity to make new accounts with power levels equal to that of their own (although, global moderators never had the power to change a user's power level). This lead to one global mod in particular to create a bunch of global moderator accounts and give them to all his friends, they caused havoc for a few hours.


* Do you have any final words you'd like to put in?


> Well, I'm trying to think of some but my brain has turned too much. :P I'd make a terrible movie villain that was about to die. Anyways, thank you for the interview Flame_. I had great fun doing it and am enjoying the prospect of reading the next issue of Mopar Monthly!
